# How to run

Simply execute runner.bash from a terminal, ensuring that `bash_test_cases.txt` exists and is populated.

To visualize the changes to the dynamic programming array, set `visualize_dp` to `1` in
[solution.bash](./solution.bash).

Also, maybe clear out the test cases and leave something like `5,1,2;11;3` to reduce the terminal clutter.

Example output:

```log
i = 1 | coin = 1 | dp: [0, 1]

i = 2 | coin = 1 | dp: [0, 1, 2]
i = 2 | coin = 2 | dp: [0, 1, 1]

i = 3 | coin = 1 | dp: [0, 1, 1, 2]
i = 3 | coin = 2 | dp: [0, 1, 1, 2]

# CSharp folder

This includes a C# solution. LeetCode doesn't have support for solving this with Bash. So a C# solution
was used to generate and validate the test cases.

Test cases can be generated by running the [CoinChange project](./CSharp/src/CoinChange/) after updating
the output path in [Program.cs](./CSharp/src/CoinChange/Program.cs`). It's recommended to run this in Release mode.

This folder also includes xUnit tests to validate against some of the test problems from LeetCode. They can simply be run from the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.

The C# solution was accepted by LeetCode.
