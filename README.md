# Algos Challenge

The `challenge` folder houses all the problems we have covered in the challenge. Each problem has it's own folder. 

To participate, inside each problem folder:
    1. Clone this repo locally. Do not fork. 
    2. Navigate to the challenge folder and find the problem you want to submit a solution for. 
    3. Create a file for your solution that is named `lastname_firstname.py`. For example, mine would be `tilawat_ash.py`.
    4. Add your solution using your language of choice inside the file. 
    5. Make a pull request on this repo. 

Please remember to: 
    - Not edit any other file but you own. 
    - Submit your own work and not use another's code.

### The best solutions will be merged and submitted into the challenge!
