# Algos Challenge

The `challenge` folder has all the challenge problems. Each problem has it's own folder for its solutions. 

To participate, inside each problem folder:

    1. Fork the repo
    2. Check out a branch (name doesn't matter)
    3. Navigate to the challenge folder and find the problem you want to submit a solution for. 
    4. Create a file for your solution that is named `lastname_firstname.py`. 
        For example, mine would be `tilawat_ash.py`.
    5. Add your solution using your language of choice inside the file. 
    6. Push your branch to your copy of the repo
    7. Open a PR comparing your branch to your repo's main branch

Please remember to:

    - Not edit any other file but your own. 
    - Submit your own work and not use another's code.

### The best solutions will be merged and submitted into the challenge!
